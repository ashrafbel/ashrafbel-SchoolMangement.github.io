    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    
    <p>This project was inspired by my desire to solve real-world problems in the education sector. I noticed that many schools face difficulties in managing student performance, tracking teacher activities, and maintaining smooth operations. The School Management project was created to simplify these processes and make school administration more efficient and user-friendly. I developed this project over the course of several months, and it serves as part of my portfolio for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com">Holberton School</a>.</p>
